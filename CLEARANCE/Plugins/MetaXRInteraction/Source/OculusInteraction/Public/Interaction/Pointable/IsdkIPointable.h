/**
 * Interface for interactable objects that can be pointed at and emit pointer events.
 *
 * IIsdkIPointable provides a standardized way for interactable components to broadcast pointer
 * events to listeners. When an interactor (such as a poke finger, ray, or grabber) interacts
 * with a pointable object, the pointable emits events through its delegate to notify subscribers
 * of state changes like hover, select, and movement. This interface is essential for building
 * responsive UI elements and interactive objects in VR/AR applications.
 *
 * Implement this interface in custom interactable components that need to communicate pointer
 * events to other systems, such as widget handlers, audio players, or visual feedback components.
 * Subscribers can bind to the delegate returned by GetInteractionPointerEventDelegate() to
 * receive notifications when pointer interactions occur.
 *
 * The following concrete implementations are provided by the Interaction SDK:
 * - UIsdkPokeInteractable: For finger-based poke interactions on surfaces
 * - UIsdkRayInteractable: For ray-based pointing interactions
 * - UIsdkGrabbableComponent: For grab interactions with objects
 *
 * @see FIsdkInteractionPointerEvent For the event data structure containing interaction details.
 * @see FIsdkInteractionPointerEventDelegate For the multicast delegate type used to broadcast
 * events.
 * @see UIsdkPokeInteractable For poke-based interaction implementation.
 * @see UIsdkRayInteractable For ray-based interaction implementation.
 * @see UIsdkGrabbableComponent For grab-based interaction implementation.
 * @see UIsdkPointableWidget For connecting pointable events to UMG widgets.
