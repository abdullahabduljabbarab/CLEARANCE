/**
 * @class AIsdkTestPokeInteractorActor
 * @brief Test actor used for automated testing of poke interactions in the Interaction SDK.
 *
 * This actor wraps a UIsdkPokeInteractor component for use in Play-In-Editor (PIE) test scenarios.
 * It provides a controlled environment for validating poke interaction behavior, including hover
 * and select state transitions, without requiring a full VR setup. The actor follows a
 * singleton-like pattern within the test world, using static Setup() and Get() methods for
 * convenient access during automated test execution.
 *
 * Typical usage involves calling Setup() at the beginning of a test to spawn the actor, then
 * using Get() to retrieve and manipulate the actor's position to simulate finger poke movements
 * toward an AIsdkTestPokeInteractableActor.
 *
 * @see UIsdkPokeInteractor For the poke interactor component this actor wraps.
 * @see AIsdkTestPokeInteractableActor For the corresponding test interactable actor.
